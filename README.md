# Text-mining Workshop
This repo contains the resources for the N8 CIR text-mining workshop. Feel free to adapt and use these for your own projects.

## Running the code

The `/demos` folder contains all the code. For the workshop, I recommend running them on Google colab using the following links:

1. Analysing the Disaster Dataset
2. Classification with a Simple model
3. Classification with Transformers
4. Named Entity Recognition
5. Prompting LLMs
